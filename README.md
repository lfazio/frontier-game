# Frontier: The Seldon Era

A persistent, browser-based multiplayer space strategy game. One world cycle every 24 hours; players
spend a limited Action Point budget and log out.

## Status

**P1 — World and time.** A generated galaxy of ~47 systems on PostgreSQL `ltree`, the command path
on real repositories, and a resumable daily tick that settles arrivals and resets Action Points.
`GET /v1/me` shows the daily overview. Next is P2, the event spine.

## Running it

```sh
make install        # uv sync
make up             # postgres + redis
make migrate
make world       # generate a galaxy
make check          # lint, types, import boundaries, tests
make demo           # watch a player spend a day's AP
uv run uvicorn frontier.adapters.api.app:app --reload
```

`make check` is the gate: `ruff`, `mypy --strict` over `domain` and `application`, `import-linter`
contracts, and the test suite. Integration tests (`make test-int`) need the database from `make up`.

## Layout

```text
src/frontier/
  domain/       pure rules — no I/O, no framework imports
  application/  use cases, ports, the command template
  adapters/     FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, in-memory, clock and RNG
  worldgen/     world description
  config/       settings and the composition root
data/rulesets/  balance values, versioned; never in code
```

The layering is enforced by `import-linter`, not by review: a domain module importing `sqlalchemy`
fails CI.
